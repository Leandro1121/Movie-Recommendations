Create a folder labeled "input" in the same directory as the source files. The contents of the "input" folder can be accessed [here]([url](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m444bufmig1paz1/AAA9FAbi-5jcSMzaHNKUgnh8a?dl=0)). Another option is to download the movie dataset [directly]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies)) here, create the "input" folder with the downloaded csv file, and then run the dataProcessing.py file to generate the processed_data.csv file.
