# Movie-Recommendations

Create a folder labeled "input" in the same directory as the gui.py and data_processing.py source files. The contents of the "input" folder can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m444bufmig1paz1/AAA9FAbi-5jcSMzaHNKUgnh8a?dl=0). Another option is to download the movie dataset [directly](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies), create the "input" folder with the dataset csv file, and then run data_processing.py to create the processed_data.csv file.
